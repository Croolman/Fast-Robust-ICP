# Fast-Robust-ICP

This repository includes the source code the paper [Fast and Robust Iterative Closet Point](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07627).

This code is protected under patent. It can be only used for research purposes. If you are interested in business purposes/for-profit use, please contact Juyong Zhang (the author, email: juyong@ustc.edu.cn).


## Compilation

The code is compiled using [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and requires Eigen. It has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 with gcc 5.4.0 and on Windows with Visual Studio 2015. An executable `FRICP` will be generated.


## Usage

The program is run with four input parameters:

1. an input file storing the source point cloud;
2. an input file storing the target point cloud;
3. an output path storing the registered source point cloud and transformation;
4. registration method:
```
0: ICP
1: AA-ICP
2: Ours (Fast ICP)
3: Ours (Robust ICP)
4: ICP Point-to-plane
5: Our (Robust ICP point-to-plane)
6: Sparse ICP
7: Sparse ICP point to plane
```
You can ignore the last parameter, in which case `Ours (Robust ICP)` will be used by default. 

Example:
```
$ ./FRICP ./data/target.ply ./data/source.ply ./data/res/ 3
```
But obj and ply files are supported.

### Initialization support 
If you have an initial transformation that can be applied on the input source model to roughly align with the input target model, you can set `use_init=true` and set `file_init` to the initial file name in `main.cpp` . The format of the initial transformation is a 4x4 matrix(`[R, t; 0, 1]`), where `R` is a 3x3 rotation matrix and `t` is a 3x1 translation vector. These numbers are stored in 4 rows, and separated by spaces in each row. This format is the same as the output transformation of this code. It is worth mentioning that this code will align the center of gravity of the initial source and target models by default before starting the registration process, but this operation will be no longer used when the initial transformation is provided. In our experiment, we directly use the output file of transformation matrix generated by [Super4PCS](https://github.com/nmellado/Super4PCS) as the initial file.
